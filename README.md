# Simple Distributed File Storage [WIP]

A decentralized file storage system built from the ground up using Go. This project demonstrates how to create a distributed network of nodes that can store, retrieve, and manage files in a peer-to-peer network.

This project is a hands-on exercise it's designed to be a learning tool and may not have all the features or optimizations of a production-ready system.
